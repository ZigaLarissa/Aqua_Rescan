    "\n",
    "Aqua Rescan is a user-friendly tool that helps you know if water is safe to drink. It uses a smart machine learning model called MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to analyze data and make accurate predictions. All the data it learns from is stored in the data folder (filename: ____). By studying patterns in the data, Aqua Rescan can classify water as either potable (safe to drink) or not. This makes it a valuable tool for ensuring clean and safe water for everyone."
